TensorFlow is a library for developing and training machine learning models. Keras is an API built on top of TensorFlow designed for neural networks and deep learning.

# Intro to Deep Learning
Object:
- create a fully-connected neural network architecture
- apply neural nets to two classic ML problems: regression and classification
- train neural nets with stochastic gradient descent, and
- improve performance with dropout, batch normalization, and other techniques
